IAC Demo for Limble

### Restrictions
1. Two (2) 8-hour workdays: 48 hours
2. Machines must be size small

### Goal

Build a server environment in AWS using terraform, this environment should host a demo wordpress website (this is just a demo to validate that the servers / database work). The web servers should be containers using AWS ECS/EKS, and the database can be a Maria/Mysql on RDS.

The infrastructure should be built up with speed in mind, so use any AWS services that you think will provide the best benefits for that.
